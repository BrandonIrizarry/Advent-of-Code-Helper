#+TITLE: Advent of Code Helper
#+AUTHOR: Brandon C. Irizarry

* Introduction
This is a small library intended to make interacting with the Advent
of Code website more programmatic. This library is inspired by

1. [[https://gist.github.com/amno1/08f4d98b425b44bb342acbfbe183116a][amno1/aoc-helper.el]]
2. [[https://github.com/keegancsmith/advent][keegancsmith/advent]]

* Things to Add
- Programmatic submission
  
  This especially might involve making a new EIEIO object modelling a
  problem's part 1 and part 2 answers. The done-customization "hook"
  would then use the applicable field in the submission.

- Handling the Part 2 Demo Example

  This is clearly missing from the current application code. ðŸ˜ž
